# Carbon-risk-pricing

In sustainable finance there are two main hypotesis on how emissions are priced by the stock markets:
- **Carbon Greening Hypotesis**: Higher emissions mean higher dividends that companies offer to attract investors despite being polluters
- **Future greening hypothesis**: Higher emissions mean lower dividends because companies tend to keep money for investing in reducing their environmental impact

For this analysis, I used data from a university Refinitive terminal. 
However, obtaining both dividend and Scope 1 & Scope 2 emission data for every company remains challenging due to the recent nature of these studies.
