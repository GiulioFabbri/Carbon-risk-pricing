# Carbon-risk-pricing

In sustainable finance there are two main hypotesis on how emissions are priced by the stock markets:
- Carbon Greening Hypotesis: Higher emissions mean higher dividends that companies offer to attract investors despite being polluters
- Future greening hypothesis: Higher emissions mean lower dividends because companies tend to keep money for investing in reducing their environmental impact

For this analysis I used data from a university Refinitive terminal, but I admit that it is virtually impossible to have both dividend and scope 1 and scope2 data for each company, since these analyses are recent.  
The results therefore cannot be generalized or provide a true picture of the European situation (with the same approach and more data that I do not have at hand, interesting research could emerge).  

The main purpose of this project is therefore to **provide an elaboration of a large body of public data** by showing some **simple and intuitive models** for investigating these relationships.
